                            <p> <b style="font-size: 60px; padding-right: 10px;"> A</b>s the world population increases, so do the resources needed to sustain and carry such a large number of humans and to follow - waste from 8 billion people. Many of these resources being found in the homes of our many neighboring environments, deforestation scars the landscapes for logs and to make place for crops, global warming acts as a catalyst towards already devastating natural disaters, Fires burn hotter and further as countries shrivel up into fuel, hurricanes and typhoons are more frequent and rampant. Animal extinction occurs when a species completely disappears from the Earth. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including habitat loss, climate change, pollution, overhunting, and disease. When a species becomes critically endangered, it means that its population has declined to the point where it is at a high risk of extinction.</p>

                               <p> The situation facing critically endangered animals is dire, as they are often on the brink of disappearing forever. Once a species goes extinct, it is lost forever, and this can have significant impacts on ecosystems and the planet as a whole. For example, the loss of a predator species can cause an increase in prey populations, leading to overgrazing or other ecosystem imbalances.</p>
                                
                               <p>In addition to ecological impacts, the loss of a species can also have economic and cultural impacts, particularly for indigenous communities that rely on wildlife for food, medicine, and other resources. Furthermore, many species have intrinsic value and play an important role in our cultural heritage and sense of identity.</p>
                                
                               <p>Overall, the loss of species is a significant threat to global biodiversity, and urgent action is needed to protect and conserve endangered animals before it is too late. This requires a collaborative effort among governments, NGOs, and the public to address the root causes of extinction and implement effective conservation measures.</p>

The following show the main threats towards these animals and their survival. All footprints from Humans squandering the resources of the planet.

                        Overhunting, overfishing, and harvesting of plants and animals for commercial purposes are reducing the population size of many species and disrupting food chains and ecosystems. This can also result in genetic changes and the loss of unique adaptations that can have cascading effects throughout the ecosystem.

                                Climate change is a global phenomenon that is affecting ecosystems and species around the world. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can lead to shifts in the timing of life cycle events, such as breeding and migration, and alter the distribution and abundance of species. This can disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems and create new threats, such as the emergence of invasive species, the spread of diseases, and the loss of genetic diversity. Species with narrow ranges, specialized ecological requirements, or limited dispersal abilities are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

                                The destruction of natural habitats is a major driver of biodiversity loss and poses a significant threat to endangered species. Human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, agriculture, and mining often result in the fragmentation, isolation, and degradation of natural habitats. This reduces the availability of resources, such as food, shelter, and breeding sites, for endangered species, and can lead to population declines, local extinctions, and genetic isolation.

                                Oil and gas developments can harm endangered species by destroying habitats, disrupting migration patterns, and polluting air and water. These developments also contribute to climate change, which further endangers species. Regulations and mitigation efforts exist, but the continued expansion of oil and gas development remains a significant threat to many endangered species.

                                Plastics have a significant impact on endangered species in several ways. Marine animals are particularly affected, as plastic waste often ends up in the ocean where it can entangle and suffocate sea turtles, dolphins, whales, and other marine mammals. Plastics can also be mistaken for food by animals, leading to ingestion and potential harm or death. Even on land, plastics can harm animals that become entangled or trapped in discarded plastic items. Additionally, the chemicals used in the production of plastics can have negative effects on animal health and reproduction. Overall, the widespread use and disposal of plastics pose a significant threat to endangered species and their habitats and is an issue that could be drastically reduced in a multitude of solutions.

The lone wild population of Javan rhinos, which numbers approximately 75 individuals, is one of the rarest rhino species in existence and is exclusively located on the Indonesian island of Java. The Ujung Kulon National Park, designated as a World Heritage Site, is the only remaining refuge for Javan rhinos. Unfortunately, the park is also under threat from the invasive Arenga palm, which reduces the rhinos' food supply and available habitat. Additionally, the small Javan rhino population is extremely susceptible to extinction due to natural disasters, diseases, poaching, and potential inbreeding.</p>

One population resides in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park of Uganda, while the other occupies the Virunga Landscape, an area with a history of political instability and a high poverty rate. The increasing human presence in these regions, with over 500,000 people residing near Mountain gorilla habitats, poses a significant threat to the gorilla population as humans encroach upon their space for food, shelter, and other purposes. Despite these challenges, the Mountain gorilla population is showing signs of recovery due to the efforts of local and international partners, including the WWF's International Gorilla Conservation Programme. As of 20222, there are only slightly over 1,000 individuals of this endangered species in the wild, and various threats to their survival continue to impede recovery efforts.

The tropical forests of the Batang Toru ecosystem on the Indonesian island of Sumatra are home to the single, isolated population of Tapanuli orangutans. Unfortunately, these tree-dwelling primates are critically endangered, with fewer than 800 individuals remaining in the wild, making them the most endangered great ape species worldwide. The main threat to their survival is habitat loss, as tropical forests are being cleared for agriculture, mining, and hydroelectric and geothermal development. Between 1985 and 2007, over 40% of the forests in the province of North Sumatra, where the Tapanuli orangutan lives, were lost.
